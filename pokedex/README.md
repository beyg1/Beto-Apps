# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

npx create-expo-app@latest pokedex

## Get started

1. Install dependencies if you are cloning

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start --tunnel 
   ```

3. npm run reset-project

   to reset the template code and start working on the app

4. Work with pokeapi.co to fetch pokemon and display in app

   use useEffect to hit api of pokeapi.co to get pokemons and use useState to save em
   in state variable and eventually render on screen.
   use Image tags and Text tags from react and make the interface by inline styling or
   separately styling the ui. 

5. Make another screen details.tsx

   it should be opened when user taps a pokemon card and show the details which we want it to show.
